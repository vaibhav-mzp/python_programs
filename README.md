# General-Purpose Python Programs

This is my personal repository of Python programs that I use for managing Linux packages. I'm a casual Linux user, and these programs have helped me automate common package management tasks and streamline my workflow.

The programs are simple and efficient, so you can easily modify them to suit your needs. As of now, the repository contains three programs related to Linux package handling, but I plan to add more programs in the future to cover other related topics as well.

Each program is well-documented with explanations and comments to make it easy to understand. You can simply download the program and run it in your Linux environment to see how it works. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue and I'll be happy to help.

While this repository is primarily intended for my personal use, you're welcome to share the programs with others or use them as a starting point for your own projects. Just make sure to credit me as the original author.

I hope you find these Python programs useful, and I look forward to hearing your feedback!
